<p><b><font size="+1">Welcome to the Wind Turbine Airfoil
Catalogue website!</font></b></p><br>

<p>This website is dedicated to give access to data
from the <A HREF="./report.htm">Wind Turbine Airfoil
Catalogue</A>. This catalogue gathers numerical and
experimental data obtained for a wide range of <A
HREF="./a_index.htm">airfoils</A> used in wind turbine
applications.</p>

<p>For each computed airfoil, numerical results have been
obtained with the incompressible Navier-Stokes
solver <tt><font size=+1>EllipSys2D</font></tt> and the
panel method code XFOIL (more details on these computational
codes <A HREF="./numerics.htm">here</A>). In most
cases, these numerical results are compared to experimental
measurements when available. Note that all measurements
available on this site were performed at low Mach numbers
so that the fluid can be considered as being nearly
incompressible.</p>

<p>The primary goal of this catalogue was to provide this
database. However, it was used to validate and evaluate the
computational code <tt><font size=+1>EllipSys2D</font></tt>.</p>

computational data, or as for the experimental data, at the references
which are given individually for <A HREF="./a_index.htm">each
