******************************

This directory contains the collection of data that have been used to
produce the figures of the following report:

'Wind Turbine Airfoil Catalogue', F.Bertagnolio, N.Sørensen, J.Johansen
and P.Fuglsang, Risø-R-1280(EN), Roskilde, Denmark, August 2001.

...and subsequent releases. A pdf version of this report is available
on internet at the following address:

****

Each directory contains data associated to one specific airfoil. The
names used for these directories corresponds to the ones used in the
report. The directory NASA-WS contains data obtained for several NACA
wing sections for which computational results were compared with
experimental data by Abbot and von Doenhoff (see report for reference).

Each airfoils directory can be subdivided in other directories when
appropriate, e.g. when several configuration tests have been performed.

All computational and experimental conditions are reported in the above
mentionned report.

****

Nomenclature for the files is as follows:

Files 'prof.dat' contains the geometry of the airfoils that have been used
in the computations (both for EllipSys2D and XFOIL). In some cases, it
has been transformed from the original geometry which has a blunt trailing
edge to a sharp trailig edge geometry.

Files starting as cl... cd... cm... cld... cldm... contains characteristic
data as angle of attack, lift, drag and moment coefficients, ususally in
this order, unless otherwise specified as commentary in the file itself.

Files starting as cp... cf... or cfp contains pressure and/or skin friction
coefficients as a function of the chord position.

Files ending with .exp correspond to experimental data. References can be
found in the catalogue itself.

Files ending with .xf correspond to numerical data obtained with XFOIL.

Files ending with .ellipsys correspond to numerical data obtained with
EllipSys2D.
